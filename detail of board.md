## 🔌 1. Power Supply Section

- **DC Jack**: Connect a 7V to 12V adapter to power the board.
- **USB B Type**: Used to power the board from a computer and upload code.
- **Voltage Regulator**: Converts the high input voltage to a stable 5V.
- **Poly Fuse**: Protects the board by cutting off power if there's too much current.
- **Protection Diode**: Prevents current from flowing in the wrong direction.

## 🧠 2. Microcontrollers

- **ATMega328P**: The main brain of the board, it runs the code.
- **ATMega16U2**: Works like a USB-to-Serial converter, allowing you to upload code via USB.

## 🧲 3. Oscillators and Clock

- **Crystal Oscillator (16 MHz)**: Keeps track of timing, very important for code execution and serial communication.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Important Circuits

- **Comparator**: Compares voltages and helps in power selection.
- **Capacitor**: Stores and releases small amounts of energy to smooth out voltage.

---

## 🔁 5. Reset and Programming

- **Reset Button**: Restarts the program from the beginning.
- **ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programmer)**: Used to program the microcontroller directly (especially if USB fails).

## 📥 6. Input/Output Pins

### 🔶 Digital I/O Pins (0–13)

- These are used for digital signals (either HIGH or LOW).
- You can use them for:
  - LEDs
  - Buttons
  - Relays
- Some pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) support PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

### 🔷 Analog Input Pins (A0–A5)

- These read varying voltage levels (0V to 5V).
- Perfect for sensors like temperature, light, and humidity.

## 📍 7. Additional Labels

- **Power Supply Pins**:
  - `5V` – Regulated 5V output
  - `3.3V` – 3.3V output
  - `GND` – Ground
  - `VIN` – Raw input voltage from adapter or battery
- **TX/RX LEDs**:
  - `TX` – Transmitting data
  - `RX` – Receiving data
